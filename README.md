# NashvilleHousingDataCleaning
Data cleaning is a broad term used to describe the process of correcting values, dealing with missing values, and making data more usable. It is a vital step in data preparation that lays the foundation for future analysis. It is a substantial aspect of most data roles. There are many tools that can be used to clean data, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use one of the more commonly used tools, SQL (PostgreSQL), to clean this dataset. 

The dataset can be found at the following URL: https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx
